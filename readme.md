## Math problem from my foo-bar challenge


### This is a small math puzzle problem from my foo bar challange about a space station.
<br />

##### So I have a space station's outer paneling, all of its solar panels must be squares.  if you had a total area of 12 square yards of solar material, you would be able to make one 3x3 square panel (with a total area of 9). That would leave 3 square yards, so you can turn those into three 1x1 square solar panels.
<br />

##### I was asked to make a function  that takes a area number(between 1 and 1000000 inclusive) and returns a list of the areas of the largest squares you could make out of those panels, starting with the largest squares first. So,solution(12) would return [9, 1, 1, 1].
